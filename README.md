# how its made
I used godot mono 4.5 which allows me to use c# with gd script, with c# i could use the win 32 api calls to do stuff like get the users
background or open some other apps.
I also used small batch scripts to simulate things like downloading kora or errors.

# Things that the game dose
once you start the game it gets two things, you background image and your user profile,
after you login and wait 10 seconds you will get a notification about downloading companion.exe if you press ignore you will get a error
once you press download it opens a batch script called download.bat using c# win32api to open it, then it simulates downloading kora
and after downloading it simulates trying to get admin premissions, which it fails, causing win32api to open error.bat 5 and simulate errors after a couple seconds it kills all the windows and simulates a pc crash causing a restart to the logon screen, then you will be presented with kora ai. you will have a coupe chats blah blah blah and then he will open your file explorer HE DOSE NOT SAVE ANY DATA FROM THERE NOR SHARES TO ANYONE. and then you say to delete him and then the game closes. yeah thats it
